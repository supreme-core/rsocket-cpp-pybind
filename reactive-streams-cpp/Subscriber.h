///   * remove rule 3. from JVM specification as it would make "unsubscribe
///     handshake" harder to implement in some cases,
///   * add a rule to define "unsubscribe handshake",
///   * add a rule to ensure single terminal signal,
///
/// Life cycle considerations:
/// 1. The Subscriber is not owned by any Producer, nor it owns a Subscription.
/// 2. Per "unsubscribe handshake", the Producer MUST always send either
///   ::{onComplete,onError} as the last signal to the Subscriber.
///   This holds even if an unsubscribe sequence is initiated by the Subscriber
///   calling Subscription::cancel. Therefore, it is perfectly possible for a
///   Subscriber to deallocate any resources it holds in ::{onComplete,onError}.
/// 3. Note that no part of ReactiveStreams specification requires the
///   Subscriber to be heap-allocated. However, if it is the case, from the
///   perspective of Producer-Subscriber interaction, it is valid for the
///   Subscriber to `delete this;` as the last statement in
///   ::{onComplete,onError}.
